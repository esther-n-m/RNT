# RNT Scented Candles

A simple e-commerce web application for selling scented candles and decorative pillows.

This project is built step-by-step as a learning project to understand how real web applications work, from static HTML to dynamic JavaScript and persistent state.

## Features

- Product listing generated dynamically from JavaScript
- Add products to cart
- Increase quantity when same product is added multiple times
- Remove items from cart
- Cart persists using localStorage (survives page refresh)
- Automatic total price calculation

## Tech Stack

- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling – upcoming)
- JavaScript (logic and interactivity)
- Browser localStorage (temporary database)

## Current Status

**Week 1:**  
HTML structure and product layout

**Week 2:**  
Dynamic product rendering with JavaScript

**Week 3:**

## Planned Next Steps

- Week 5: Styling with CSS
- Week 6: Better UI/UX (cards, grid, buttons)
